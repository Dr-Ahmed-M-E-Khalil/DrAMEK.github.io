      <p><em>Department of Earth System Science and Technology, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Engineering Sciences (IGSES)</em></p>
      <p>2014 – 2017 | Ranking: Top Seven Universities in Japan</p>
      <p>Overall Grade: 1st, GPA: 4.0/4.0</p>
      <p><em>Funded by:</em> Monbukagakusho (MEXT), Japanese Government Prestigious Doctoral Scholarship</p>
      <p><strong>Thesis Title:</strong> Promoting the Reactivity of Nano-scale Zero-valent Iron for Water Treatment: Mechanisms and Application</p>
      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Professor Osama Eljamal | <strong>Supporter:</strong> Professor Nobuhiro Matsunaga</p>
      <p><strong>Thesis Overview:</strong> This research explored the development of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) composites to enhance water treatment efficiency and stability. The work involved surface modifications and carrier support, improving nitrate and phosphate removal through the addition of distinctive metal ions. A novel composite showed increased reactivity, material regeneration, and successful application in a laboratory-scale continuous flow system.

      <p><strong>Supervisors:</strong> MIT PhD and MSc holder, Professor Seif-Eddeen Khalid Fateen, Professor Mai Kamal Fouad</p>
      <p><strong>Thesis Overview:</strong> This project addressed phase stability and equilibrium in reactive and non-reactive thermodynamic systems using advanced stochastic swarm algorithms. Three algorithms—Monkey Algorithm (MA), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA)—were evaluated, with KHA emerging as the most reliable. A hybrid algorithm (MAKHA), combining MA and KHA elements, demonstrated superior performance in solving complex thermodynamic benchmarks. This innovative approach highlighted the potential of MAKHA for process engineering design.
